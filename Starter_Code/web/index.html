              Are we alone in the universe? For millennia, humans have turned to the sky to answer
              this question. Now, thanks to research generously funded by W. Avy, a UFO-enthusiast
              and amatuer Ufologist, we can supplement our sky-searching with data analysis. <br><br>"The
              release of this analysis is well-timed: it coincides with the celebration of World UFO
              Day, which is a moment for ufologists around the world to connect, relax, and sample a
              range of UFO-themed snacks," said Dr. Ursula F. Olivier, the world's preeminent expert
              on circular sightings. "Citizen-scientists can be especially helpful in both
              cataloguing sightings - which is hugely helpful for us in our search for aliens - and
              in helping us celebrate the work that has already been done, such as this data
              visualisation project, which will help us raise awareness of the ubiquity of
              sightings!"<br><br> Not everyone is ready to celebrate, however. Local CEO and vocal
              anti-alien activist V Isualize reached out to our reporters to go on record as firmly
              opposed to any attempts to provide access to this data. "If there are aliens, they
              certainly would like to be left alone," she stated, before directing us to the Leave
              Aliens Alone (LAA) community engagement initiative she founded and funds. <br><br>So what do
              YOU think? Dig through the data yourself, and let us know what you see.
