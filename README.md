# UFOs

## Overview

This project aims at creating a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array. Likewise, this table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.

JavaScript is a well-established coding language that was designed to enhance HTML. It's the backbone of many popular visualization libraries, such as Plotly, and is often used to create custom dashboards. JavaScript also provides a high level of customization: the dashboards built to deliver visual data, such as maps or graphs, can be as simple or complex as needed.

## Resources

- Data Tools: ECMAScript, JavaScript, Jupyter Notebook, Python and MongoDB
- Software: ES6+, ECMAScript, MongoDB, Python 3.6.8, Visual Studio Code 1.50.0

J

- JavaScript's code style, according to coding guidelines and syntax, is **camel case** (camelCase)
- In JavaScript, a print statement is called a **console log**.

## Statements and Expressions

- Statements perform actions.
- Expressions create values.

## Code Blocks

Code blocks are denoted by curly brackets. Code inside the curly brackets are typically indented two to four spaces.

## Variables

JavaScript adds var before the variable, and then add a semicolon after the value, like this: **var y = 2;**.

## Create Variables with let

- When a developer chooses to use let, it basically means "I might want to use this variable again later to hold different data, but in this code block I'll only use it once." 

## Create Variables with const

- const tells JavaScript that the variable won't be reassigned or redeclared, either in a block of code or within the program as a whole.

1. **Deliverable 1**: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
2. **Deliverable 2**: A written report on the UFO analysis README.md.
